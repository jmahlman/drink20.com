Last year, almost a year ago to the day, we posted our welcome message. At long last, we're finally getting things rolling with our first location, [Broken Goblet Brewing](https://brokengoblet.com)!

### Some History on Drink20

Drink20 started out as a live-play podcast with custom drinking rules for play. We were really bad at releasing things on schedule, but we managed to release 10 episodes before the pandemic and subsequent lock-downs. We had grandiose ideas of running our sessions at and in conjunction with local breweries, getting them to sponsor us, and more. Of course, this all just stopped completely in March 2019. After a few months, we knew the podcast was dead, and so Drink20 went into hibernation for another time.

### Flash forward to 2023

Broken Goblet Brewing has been our local brewery for years and I personally have been an Irregular (that's their mug club) for a number of years. Each year, their have a theme for their club. The owner, being a big nerd, did lots of nerdy themes; one year was Game of Thrones, one year was "Wizarding" (you know..that *thing*), you get the idea. In 2023, their theme was D&D! When this was announced, we chatted with their co-owner, Mike, and mentioned our idea of running **games** (not a drinking podcast) at breweries in our area. He absolutely loved it and told us to send him info right away.

We worked out some details over a few months and had everything ready to go for when they opened their new lounge space (now called *The Mixing Room*). Due to many complications, this start date kept slipping, so much so that we thought we were not going to do this and have to either find another location or just hang it up again.

However, good things come to those who wait.

Broken Goblet has officially [announced](https://www.facebook.com/BrokenGoblet/posts/pfbid02k7HcnzHXZk78Y8AdHjk13S2mmRYk3NKNh6xDF1HFfjga4sZZYpdt22jcXYGPy9nPl) that they are opening on Tuesdays and with our help will be running *Tabletop Tuesdays* in the Mixing room!

### What's Next?

We had a call out for DMs and we received a good deal of respondents. We are reaching out to them right now with more info. At this moment, scheduling is TBD but the games will be **monthly on a Tuesday**, at least in the beginning.

So, when the date is set, come by to play and bring your friends! We would love to see this event get big enough to have more than two tables, and possibly expand to other locations!

Any questions, reach out!

Cheers!
